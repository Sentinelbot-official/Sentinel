**No Support Obligation**: Forks, derivatives, or modifications do not receive support, updates, or assistance from Nexus Bot or its developers. You may not claim or imply that support is available through official Nexus Bot channels for your derivative work.

**Commercial Use Disclaimer**: While this license permits commercial use of the code, you may NOT use Nexus Bot's branding, name, or protected materials in any commercial context without explicit written permission. Commercial forks must clearly distinguish themselves from the official Nexus Bot in all customer-facing materials.
